I felt like making a bonsai so I decided to do it in Blender! First, I made a sort of wire bonsai, which I then gave thickness. I then sculpted in details and made the rock and the bowl. Next, I added a particle system to the branches and added leaves. After that, I textured everything and put it into a nice scene.

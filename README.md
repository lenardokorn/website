# Lenard Okorn's personal website

This is my personal website which I built using Next.js.

## Content

- Home page with About section
- School page where you can see my homework
- Personal Projects page where I showcase various personal projects

## What I used

- **Next.js** as a frontend framework
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Three.js** so that I can display 3D models
- **Framer Motion** for page transitions
- **Remark** to convert Markdown to HTML
- **ESLint, Prettier and Visual Studio Code** to make coding as enjoyable as possible

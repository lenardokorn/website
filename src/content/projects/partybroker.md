This web application was developed together with my friends, Johann, Nina, Paul, and Tobias. We wanted to create a tool that allows people to create easily shareable links that they can send to their friends as party invitations. From there, the guests can enter information regarding their attendance, sleeping arrangements and drinks or snacks that they will bring.

For us, it was important that a guest does _not_ have to create an account – because we think that removing friction is vital to making the tool fun to use. That is also why we designed it as a Progressive Web App – no need to manually install an app.

Ever since its inception, the app has been in use very often. Ultimately, I think what makes this project so special is the fact that we got the opportunity to create something that we and our friends actually _want_.

You can take a look at it at [partybroker.at](https://www.partybroker.at).

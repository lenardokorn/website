WaveRave is a game that I developed together with my friends Michael, Nina and Paul.

You play as Mat, who works as a bouncer for the _Club Mate_ nightclub. It is located on a remote tropical island, but there is one problem: The loud music disturbs the creatures living deep in the ocean – causing them to start emerging from the water and trying to destroy the nightclub as soon as the night begins and the music starts.

The player's objective is to defend the club for as long as possible, as the enemy waves get stronger night after night. For this, the player has a banana gun and an energy drink can which acts like a bomb after shaking it. In the daytime, you can regain some health and repair the nightclub building.

Developing this game was very fun and it felt like the ideas just kept on coming. And the best part is that it is actually fun to play – many visitors at HTL Kaindorf open day 2024 played and really enjoyed it.
